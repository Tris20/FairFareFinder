# Current
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mborsetti/airportsdata/main/airportsdata/airports.csv
- Correctly lists glasgow internaltion as glasgow
- correctly lists glasgow prestwick as glasgow
- Doesnt have utf issues



# ourairports.com
airports.csv in other_data_sources from https://davidmegginson.github.io/ourairports-data/airports.csv
Can also be found on ourairports.com 

Problematic because it lists "glasgow" as having municipality "Paisley, renfrew", which would send skyscanner and airbnb etc to paisley instead of glasgow


# detailed_json
Cant remeber where i got it from. 
- municipality data generally ok, 
- full of utf encoding issues
