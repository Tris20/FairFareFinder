**Final Flight Price Formula:**

\[
\text{PRICE}_{\text{final}} = (\text{BA} \times \text{FD}) \times \text{AM} \times \text{PM} \times \text{DM} \times \text{FFM} \times \text{SNM} \times \text{ACM} \times \text{RCM}
\]

**Where:**

- **BA (Base Price per Minute):**  
  The fundamental cost per minute of flight (e.g., â‚¬0.15/min).

- **FD (Flight Duration):**  
  The total duration of the flight in minutes.

- **AM (Airline Multiplier):**  
  A factor reflecting the airline's relative pricing level (e.g., low-cost carriers might have values below 1, while full-service airlines might be above 1).

- **PM (Population Modifier):**  
  A multiplier based on the populations of the origin and destination cities (derived from a population bracket table).

- **DM (Date/Season/Holiday Modifier):**  
  A factor that increases prices during peak travel periods (such as holidays or school breaks).

- **FFM (Flight-Frequency Modifier):**  
  A modifier based on the number of direct flights available over a set time period (fewer flights usually mean higher prices).

- **SNM (Short-Notice Modifier):**  
  A factor reflecting how many days before departure the booking is made (last-minute bookings typically have higher multipliers).

- **ACM (Aircraft Capacity Multiplier):**  
  A multiplier based on the size or seating capacity of the aircraft (smaller aircraft tend to have higher per-seat costs).

- **RCM (Route Classification Multiplier):**  
  A factor that adjusts for the nature of the route (e.g., pure business, mixed business/leisure, or pure leisure) to capture qualitative differences in demand.
