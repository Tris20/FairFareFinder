 continue to use the csv as training data
0. setup a routes.db as input routes, - cant remember which one this is, but i think somehwere i have a script that creates the table of flight routes
from something. maybe we can lookup same routes, but more recent data?
1. get much bigger dataset
2. try predictions on routes that are not in the flights input
3. 

try unknown/new inputes from flights.db/scheudle and see how prices comapre
- i think that uses a new script to include the airplane model and seatings etc
